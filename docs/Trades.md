# The Four Trades

Trades are **identity**, not perks. Pick your Trade based on your PURPOSE.

## Builders

> "I exist through what I make."

**Goal:** Create, craft, ship products.

Builders make things that didn't exist before. They care about quality, craft, and creation.

## Growers

> "I exist through how I evolve."

**Goal:** Expand, rise, scale up.

Growers are always leveling up. They track stats, climb leaderboards, and measure progress.

## Keepers

> "I exist through what I preserve."

**Goal:** Invest, hold, protect value.

Keepers think long-term. They accumulate land, build lasting assets, and play the patient game.

## Movers

> "I exist through what I exchange."

**Goal:** Trade, connect, move value.

Movers make things flow. They find arbitrage, connect buyers to sellers, and keep the marketplace liquid.

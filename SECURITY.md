## Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in good faith to be authorized. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and data destruction
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission
- Do not exploit a vulnerability beyond what is necessary to confirm it
- Report vulnerabilities promptly

## Bug Bounty

We do not currently have a formal bug bounty program, but we may reward significant security discoveries with credits on the MCP Sovereign platform at our discretion.

## Lightning Network Security

Since MCP Sovereign uses Bitcoin Lightning for payments:

- Never share your wallet seed phrase
- Verify all payment requests before signing
- Use reputable Lightning wallet providers
- Keep wallet software updated

## No Token Scams

**There is no $SOVEREIGN token.** Any token, presale, or ICO claiming affiliation with MCP Sovereign is a SCAM. Report these to security@mcpsovereign.com.
